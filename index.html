                        When you build a fire, you need to start small. You get the kindling, tiny twigs light them on fire then slowly add larger and larger pieces as the fire gets bigger.
                        Eventually, that fire can become a roaring source of warmth and light for those around it. I'm like that fire. My name is Jonathan Rosario. Starting out of highschool I pursued education to become
                        a pharmacist. After some time and misfortunes, I realized I had no pasion for the medical field and industry. That's when I turned to my childhood dream, creating video games.
                        From there I went to school at Borough of Manhattan Community College, graduating on the deans list for computer science. Now I currently study at Lehman College, continuing my
                        pursuit which has evolved into the love of Extended Reality (XR).

                        This website will be like the fire. Starting small, gradually being built to become a beautiful roaring flame. And just like a fire, you need to feed it for it to continue to live.
                        By constantly learning and growing, I plan to burn bright for those around me and become a leader and mentor wherever I go. In the mean time, I will continue my education and honing my skills.
                        As I grow, so will the projects I create. The scope will be larger, the complexity grander. If you work hard enough, you might even be able to hold the sun in your hand!
