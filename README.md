# Portfolio for TTP Cohort 6 Assessment - Jonathan Rosario

A work-in-progress of my portfolio website. Designed over the past two days, it was quite a challenge but a great learning experience. Hope you get as much enjoyment looking through it as I did creating it! The website will continue to grow in time as my skill progress. Look forward to new updates and maybe even some games!!
