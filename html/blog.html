                <p>Welcome to my first website! It is a work in progress and will get updated periodically. So far it is a hacked together website using multiple tutorials and not following "best practices". 
                    It has been quite a challenge but alot more fun than I had expected! Getting the "hero" scroll to work the way I wanted required multiple articles, but I am really happy with the effect.
                    Fun fact, the fire picture is one I shot on my most recent camping trip in the Catskills. The hike was very inspiring and really pushed me towards quitting my job and focusing on school.
                    Building this site for my portfolio and bootcamp assessment has been so rewarding. I cannot wait to apply the new skills that I'll learn and make the site beautiful and something I can
                    be proud of for years to come! Thank you for taking the time to read my first post, I hope you enjoy the content. Here's a picture of my girlfriend's cat. Her name is Molly and she's very
                    sweet.
