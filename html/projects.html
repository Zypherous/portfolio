                <h3>VR CAMPUS</h3>
                <p>
                    This project is a prototype of a virtual reality classroom. I made it with the help of three other's in my class. Our goal was to try and create
                    an environment free of distractions where an instructor, students, and others can interact and learn. The project was quite challenging as we 
                    wanted to make it as accessible as possible through the use of Google VR. Google VR does not have native hand and gesture recognition. Using Manomotion,
                    and coding it to work with Google VR allowed for some buggy but somewhat functional gesture recognition. This allowed the creation of a whiteboard
                    where a user can grab a "pen" and write on the board. I will return to this project when I have time and my professor is willing to be my mentor 
                    for that project! Feel free to take a look at the documentation I created for this project <a href="https://github.com/Zypherous/CSC-331-Final-Project">here</a>.

                <h3>Balloon Sweeper</h3>
                <p>
                    Transferring over to Lehman College required that I learned Java. In order to master Java I worked on a minesweeper clone. Very simple and fun to play.
                    The code can be viewed upon request, did not want to have it public in case it is used as a project for the class again. There are two videos, a code walk through
                    and a video demonstration of the game in action. You can find the walkthrough <a href="https://youtu.be/cvxKndH_9wY">here</a>.

                <h3>Short Unity Demo</h3>
                <p>
                    A short demonstration of a quick game I made in unity. It is incomplete and a prototype but helped me learn how to use Unity in order to work on the VR Campus project.
